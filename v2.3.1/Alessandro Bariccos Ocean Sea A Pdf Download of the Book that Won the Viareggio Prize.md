Ocean Sea is a novel by Italian author Alessandro Baricco, first published in 1993. It is a postmodern fable of human malady--psychological, existential, erotic--and the sea as a means of deliverance. The novel intertwines the stories of several characters who converge at the Almayer Inn, a remote shoreline hotel, where they seek healing, redemption, or escape from their pasts. Among them are an artist who paints the sea with ocean water, a scientist who writes love letters to a woman he has never met, an adulteress who searches for relief from her proclivity to fall in love, and a sixteen-year-old girl who suffers from a mysterious condition that science has failed to cure. Their fates are influenced by a mighty tempest and a ghostly mariner with a thirst for vengeance, who haunts the inn and the nearby sea.
 
Ocean Sea is a novel of striking originality and wisdom, blending elements of magical realism, metafiction, and poetry. Baricco explores themes such as the power of the sea, the nature of love, the meaning of life, and the role of art and literature in human existence. He also challenges the conventions of narrative and language, creating a lyrical and playful text that defies genre and classification. Ocean Sea is a captivating and enchanting read that will transport you to a world of mystery and beauty.

Ocean Sea is divided into four parts, each corresponding to a different season and a different stage of the characters' journeys. The first part, "The Almayer Inn", introduces the main characters and their reasons for coming to the inn. The second part, "The Wave", depicts the arrival of the storm and the mariner, who unleashes his wrath on the inn and its guests. The third part, "The Sea", reveals the secrets and connections between the characters, as well as the true nature of the mariner and his mission. The fourth part, "The Return", concludes the novel with the resolution of the characters' conflicts and the transformation of their lives.
 
Ocean Sea is a novel that invites multiple interpretations and readings, as it is rich in symbolism, allegory, and intertextuality. Baricco draws inspiration from various sources, such as mythology, philosophy, religion, art, and literature. He references works by Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, Melville, Poe, Verne, and others. He also creates his own mythology and cosmology, inventing names and concepts that evoke a sense of wonder and mystery. Ocean Sea is a novel that challenges the reader to question their own assumptions and beliefs, and to explore the infinite possibilities of the human imagination.

Ocean Sea is not only a novel, but also a musical and a theatrical project. Baricco collaborated with composer Paolo Conte and director Gabriele Vacis to create a musical version of the novel, which premiered in 1998. The musical features songs and dialogues inspired by the novel, as well as original compositions by Conte. Baricco also adapted the novel for the stage, creating a theatrical version that was performed in 2003. The theatrical version combines elements of drama, comedy, and poetry, and uses minimal props and scenery to create a suggestive atmosphere.

It has been translated into more than 20 languages and has won several awards, such as the Viareggio Prize and the Prix MÃ©dicis Ãtranger. It has also been praised by many critics and authors, such as Umberto Eco, Salman Rushdie, and J.M. Coetzee.
