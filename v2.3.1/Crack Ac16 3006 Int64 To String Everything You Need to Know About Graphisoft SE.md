# How to Crack ArchiCAD 16 INT64 Installer
 
ArchiCAD 16 INT64 is a software program developed by Graphisoft that allows architects to design and model buildings using BIM (Building Information Modeling) approach. ArchiCAD 16 INT64 is a self-extracting installer that requires a string as a third argument to run. This string is a key that verifies the authenticity of the installer and prevents unauthorized use. In this article, we will show you how to crack the installer and generate a valid string for the third argument.
 
## Step 1: Analyze the Installer
 
The installer file is named AC16-3006-INT64.exe and it is a Windows executable file. We can use a tool like PE Explorer or Resource Hacker to inspect the file and see its resources and sections. We can also use a tool like IDA Pro or OllyDbg to disassemble the file and see its assembly code. By doing so, we can find out how the installer checks the string and what algorithm it uses to generate it.

## Step 2: Reverse Engineer the Algorithm
 
After analyzing the installer, we can see that it uses a simple algorithm to generate the string from a 64-bit value. The algorithm is as follows:
 
1. The installer takes a 64-bit value as an input and splits it into four 16-bit values.
2. It then converts each 16-bit value into a hexadecimal string and concatenates them together.
3. It then adds a prefix of "AC16-" and a suffix of "-INT64" to the hexadecimal string and returns it as the output.

For example, if the input value is 0xA40F1001, the output string will be "AC16-A40F1001-INT64".
 
## Step 3: Find a Valid Input Value
 
Now that we know how the algorithm works, we need to find a valid input value that will produce a valid output string. To do this, we can use a tool like Hashcat or John the Ripper to perform a brute-force attack on the algorithm. We can also use a tool like Python or C++ to write our own script that will try different input values until it finds one that matches the output string format.
 
Alternatively, we can use some logic and intuition to guess a valid input value. We can observe that the output string has some fixed parts: "AC16-" at the beginning, "-INT64" at the end, and "0F10" in the middle. This means that the input value must have these parts as well: 0x??0F10??, where ?? are unknown bytes. We can also observe that the output string has some variable parts: "A4" and "01" at the beginning and end of the hexadecimal part. This means that the input value must have these parts as well: 0xA40F10?? or 0x??0F1001, where ?? are unknown bytes.
 
We can then try some common values for ??, such as 00, FF, or any other byte that makes sense. For example, we can try 0xA40F1000 or 0x000F1001 as possible input values. If we plug them into the algorithm, we get:

- 0xA40F1000 -> AC16-A40F1000-INT64
- 0x000F1001 -> AC16-000F1001-INT64

We can see that both of these values produce valid output strings that match the format of "Crack Ac16 3006 Int64 To String". Therefore, we can use either of them as our third argument for the installer and crack it successfully.
