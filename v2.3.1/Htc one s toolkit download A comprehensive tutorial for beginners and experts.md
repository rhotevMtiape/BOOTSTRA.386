## How is HTC One S Performance?
 
The HTC One S is powered by a 1.5GHz dual-core Snapdragon S4 processor, which is one of the fastest and most efficient processors available for Android devices. The processor is paired with 1GB of RAM, which ensures smooth multitasking and gaming performance. The HTC One S runs on Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich with HTC Sense 4.0, which adds some useful features and enhancements to the stock Android experience. For example, you can access a quick settings panel by swiping down from the top of the screen, launch apps from the lock screen by dragging their icons into a ring, and enjoy Beats Audio sound enhancement when using headphones or external speakers.
 
The HTC One S also has a 4.3-inch Super AMOLED display with qHD resolution (540 x 960 pixels), which offers vibrant colors, deep blacks, and wide viewing angles. However, some users may notice the Pentile matrix arrangement of the pixels, which can cause some jagged edges and color fringing on text and icons. The display is also not as sharp as some of the competitors with higher resolution screens, such as the HTC One X or the Samsung Galaxy S III. The display is protected by Gorilla Glass, which makes it resistant to scratches and cracks.
 
## How is HTC One S Camera?
 
The HTC One S boasts an 8-megapixel camera with LED flash, autofocus, face detection, geotagging, and continuous shooting mode. The camera can also record 1080p video at 30fps, and snap photos while recording video. The camera interface is simple and intuitive, with a shutter button on the right side and a switch to toggle between photo and video mode on the left side. You can also access various settings and modes by tapping on the screen or swiping up from the bottom.
 
The camera quality of the HTC One S is generally good, especially in daylight conditions. The photos have good detail, color accuracy, and dynamic range. The camera also performs well in low-light situations, thanks to the backside-illuminated sensor and the f/2.0 aperture lens. However, some users may find the photos to be oversaturated, noisy, or blurry at times. The video quality is also decent, but not outstanding. The videos have smooth framerate, clear audio, and good stabilization, but they may suffer from some artifacts, jello effect, or focus hunting.
