## How to Use WaveMachine Labs Drumagog Platinum VST RTAS V4 11 Incl Keygen AiR Rar
  
To use WaveMachine Labs Drumagog Platinum VST RTAS V4 11 Incl Keygen AiR Rar, you will need to have a drum track that you want to replace with new samples. You can use any audio file that contains drum sounds, such as a recorded live performance, a MIDI file, or a loop. You can also create a new drum track from scratch using your DAW's built-in instruments or other plug-ins.
  
Once you have your drum track ready, insert Drumagog as a plug-in on the track. You will see the main interface of Drumagog, which consists of three tabs: Main, Samples, and Advanced[^6^]. The Main tab is where you do most of the work, such as setting the trigger threshold, sensitivity, and resolution, selecting the sound to be triggered, adjusting the wet/dry mix of incoming audio and triggered sound, and matching the pitch of the sample to the source[^6^]. The Samples tab is where you can load and edit your own samples or choose from the built-in library of GOG-format samples[^6^]. The Advanced tab is where you can access some additional features, such as auto hi-hat tracking, plug-in hosting, phase alignment, morphing engine, and MIDI output[^6^].
  
The basic workflow of using Drumagog is as follows:

1. Set the input level so that the incoming signal fills most of the rolling display in the lower left corner of the Main tab[ 8cf37b1e13
